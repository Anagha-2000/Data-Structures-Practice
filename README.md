# Data-Structures-Practice
This repository contains all the programs for 100 Days of Code. I will post the questions here and also include the link to the solution. **The programs are in C language.**

# Questions : 
## Day 1

**1.** Write a program to define stacks using arrays.

**2.** Write a program to convert and display the binary form of the number.

**3.** Write a program to test whether a string of opening and closing paranthesis is well formed or not.

**4.** Write a program to determine if the input character string is of the form 'xCy' where x is a string consisting of letters 'A' and 'B' and y is the reverse of x. 
       eg. if x="ABBABA", y must be equal to "ABABBA". At each point you may read only the next character of the string.
